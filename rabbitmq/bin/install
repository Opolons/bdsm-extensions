# Install a recent version of Erlang.

# Download rabbitmq-server-generic-unix-version.tar.gz, where version is the version of RabbitMQ Server you want to install.

#Contained in the tarball is a directory named rabbitmq_server-version.
#You should extract this into somewhere appropriate for application binaries on your system.

# Within the sbin directory is a shell script rabbitmq-server which may need customisation for your installation.
# Environment variables available for configuration are
RABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE
#Defaults to /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia. Set this to the directory where Mnesia database files should be placed.
RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE
#Defaults to /var/log/rabbitmq. Log files generated by the server will be placed in this directory.
RABBITMQ_NODENAME
#Defaults to rabbit. This can be useful if you want to run more than one node per machine - RABBITMQ_NODENAME should be unique per erlang-node-and-machine combination. See clustering on a single machine for more.
RABBITMQ_NODE_IP_ADDRESS
#Defaults to 0.0.0.0. This can be changed if you only want to bind to one network interface.
RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT
#Defaults to 5672.
RABBITMQ_CLUSTER_CONFIG_FILE
#Defaults to /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq_cluster.config. If this file is present it is used by the server to auto-configure a RabbitMQ cluster. See the clustering guide for details.
RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE
#Defaults to /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq. If this file is present it is used by the server to configure RabbitMQ application components. Note that the .config extension is automatically appended by the Erlang runtime.
